This addon is a modified version of the Blender 2.79 STL import addon.
The only change is at the end of stl_utils.py.
It was created to help with CLI-based STL import.

TODO:
-Test with newer Blender versions.
-Remove if latest default STL addon provides sufficient functionality. If not, suggest change upstream?
